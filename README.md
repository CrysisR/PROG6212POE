# **The Contract Monthly Claims System: The Answer to Easy Claims Management**  
**By Tyron Jeremiah Naidoo (ST10385722)**  

## **1. Intro**  
### _**The Contract Monthly Claims System**_ aims to streamline the process of creating monthly lesson claims for lecturers who work on a monthly contract, also known as Independent Contract Lecturers.  

With this system:  
- Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can **review**, **approve**, or **deny** submitted claims based on provided information.  
- An **Admin** can manage the application, allowing for the creation of new Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers.

## **5. Frequently Asked Questions**  

### **Q: Why can't I select my role from the register page?**  
A: Due to security concerns, this feature is restricted to an **Admin-only** page. You need to be verified as a staff member first.  

### **Q: Why does my page keep refreshing when I upload a document?**  
A: Common causes include:  
- Unsupported file types: **.pdf, .xlsx, .docx, .pptx, .png, .jpg**  
- File size exceeding **5MB**  

### **Q: How do I know if my claim is being reviewed?**  
A: All claims are stored in the database. Staff members can sort claims by status. If a claim hasnâ€™t been addressed in **2 weeks**, please email us at **claimsreportcmcs@gmail.com**.  

### **Q: Once a user is demoted from Admin, can they be promoted again?**  
A: **No.** Demotion is a permanent decision to restrict admin privileges.  

### **Q: How do I test the application's functions?**  
A: Follow these steps to run the **unit tests**:  

1. Open the `PROG6212POETesting` file in the base `PROG6212POE` folder.
